In this github repositories, I will be working towards establishing a model using new AI and AI-based methods. I fully recognize that I am on a long and uncertain journey, but I want to open the door for other researchers who can take what I am doing to the next level.

I know the notebook may seem scattered, I have tried to share an original path - which is sure be riddled with errors and issues. I think this is what research is all about. In the end, we get to a reliable goal and good results, hopefully. Please feel free to do with this what you like and use this process with a clean conscience.
